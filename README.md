# ARCTICELLIS ArcticSimmetAlley 

Description: 
This map fixes and updates Simmet Alley which is based on Santee Alley in Los Angeles.
I have removed some old props and overgrowing weeds and plants and updated the ground and building textures in and around the surrounding area to reflect what Santee Alley would be like. Giving the location an updated, fresh and clean feel.

## Installation

I try to make all my work easily installable to your servers so you should simply be able to:

> Drag and drop the ArcticSimmetAlley into your resources
> Add ArcticSimmetAlley to your server.cfg or extenal.cfg file
